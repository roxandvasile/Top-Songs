From javascript to Angular

Replicate the Songs Top behaviour but using Angular features as follows:

- create a Song component which displays Song info (artist, name, date, votes, buttons) and a SongTop Angular component to display songs and handle their top positioning; add separate scss styling to each components
- create a Song interface to use across the app
- for this first Angular homework, you can just hardcode a Song array, pass it to the SongTop component and using a ngFor directive, render the Song components
- optionally, you can deep dive into Angular as much as you like and can extend the homework as much as you please to mimic the previous homework written in plain javascript.
